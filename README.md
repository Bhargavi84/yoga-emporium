* This website is developed by using Gitpod workspace and GitHub repository to commit and push changes. This project uses GitHub for hosting and has been deployed using Heroku and also Amazon S3 for storing the media files.

* Following steps can be used to access the page :-


### **Download**
* Git hub navigate to https://github.com/Bhargavi84/yoga-emporium
* Click the **Code** button.
* Click the **Download Zip**.
* Extract 

### **Clone Repository**

* GitHub navigate to https://github.com/Bhargavi84/yoga-emporium
* Click the Code button.
* To clone with HTTPS copy the URL in the box https://github.com/Bhargavi84/yoga-emporium.git
* Open your Git Bash.
* Changed the directory to the location where you want to clone.
* Type git clone than paste the copied URL git clone https://github.com/Bhargavi84/yoga-emporium.git
Press Enter , your local clone will be created.

### **Deployment to Heroku**
* **Set up workspace for Heroku**:

    * In the terminal window of IDE, create a requirements.txt file to store all applications and dependencies required to run the project.
    *        pip3 freeze --local . requirements.txt

    * Create a Procfile (strictly capital P and no file extension!) - required by Heroku, to know which file runs the app.

    *          pip3 install gunicorn

    *          web: gunicorn yoga_emporium.wsgi:application 
    
* **Create application in Heroku**:

    * Navigate to [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and create an account.
    * Once logged in, click on the New button and select Create New App
    * Create a name for your app and select the region closest to your location.
    * Get free Hobby dev Heroku Postgres

* **S3 Bucket Creation using AWS**

* AWS is Amazon’s cloud-based storage service is used to store this project's static and image files.
    * Create an account if you don't have one already. Click on "Create new aws account" follow instructions.
    * Once login is created, Navigate to the AWS management console.
    * In the search bar search s3, this can be found in the services section. Open s3 and create a new bucket.
    * Enter the name of your bucket (to keep things consistant give the name which matches your respective project).Select the region that is closest to you.
    * Uncheck block public access box. Then click create bucket.
    * Once you have created the bucket, click on the bucket, and enter the following details-
        * Under Properties, turn on static website hosting
        * Under Permissions, paste in the CORS configuration:

        ![plot](static/images/) 

* Navigate to bucket policy and select policy generator. This will create a security policy for the bucket.
* Policy type will be s3 bucket policy, allow all principles by selecting the star. For action select get object.
* Copy the ARN (Amazon resource name) from the bucket policy tab. Paste the copied ARN into the box at the bottom. Once added click Add Statement. Click Generate Policy, copy this policy into the bucket policy editor.
* Do not click save yet. First allow access to all resources in the bucket. You can do this by add "/*" at the end of the resource key.
* Go to access control list tab and set the list objects permission for everyone under the Public Access section.
* Now that the s3 bucket is set up. You now need to create a user in order to access the bucket. To do this use another    Amazon service called IAM (identity and Access Management).
* In the search box type in IAM and click on the result.
* Click groups and create a new group. Do not worry about any of the tabs, click all the way through to create the group.
* Create the policy to access the bucket by clicking policies and then create policy.
* Navigate to the JSON tab, import managed policy, search for s3 and import S3 Full Access Policy.
* Go back to the bucket policy page and copy the ARN, paste the ARN in the JSON section.
* Click review policy, give the policy a name (project name + policy at the end) and a description, then click create policy.
* Attach the policy to the group that was just created. Go to groups, manage my group, click attach policy, search for the policy that was just created and select it. Then click attach policy.
* Create a user for the group. On the user's page, click add user, create a new user and give them programmatic access. Then select next.
* Add newly created user to group. Download the CSV file, this file contains the users access key and secret access key. 
* These keys are needed to authenticate the user from the Django app. MAKE SURE YOU SAFELY STORE THE CSV FILE, IT CAN NOT BE SEEN OR DOWNLOADED AGAIN
* Connect Django to s3, you'll need to install 2 new packages :
* pip3 install boto3
* pip3 install django-storages
* Freeze requirements.txt
* pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
* Add 'storages' to installed apps in settings.py file
* To connect Django to s3, you'll need to add some parameters in settings.py to tell Django which bucket it is communicating with

![plot](static/images/) 

* Go to Heroku, in the convig vars, add USE_AWS = True. Add the AWS access key and secret access key
* Remove disable collectstatic from Heroku config vars
* Create a file called custom_storages.py
* In settings.py add the following statements to tell Django where the static files will come form in production

![plot](static/images/) 

* Then git commit all changes



* **Connect your app to GitHub repository**:

    * On the Deploy page, select GitHub as your Deployment method.
    * You will then be prompted to find the github repository, click on Connect button to connect.
    * Choose a branch to deploy as main.
    * Click on the Settings  and select Config Vars and Reveal Config Vars.
    * Add the following variables.

    ![plot](static/images/)

* Now go back to Heroku and click on Enable Automatic Deployment and Deploy Branch.

  * https://git.heroku.com/bhargavi84-yoga-emporium-ms4.git

* The app is now connected and Heroku will receive the code from GitHub and will access the static files and media files using S3 bucket from AWS and automatically updates whenever changes is pushed to the GitHub repository. You should be able to see "Your app was successfully deployed!". Click on View to launch your app.
* Click on Open App to test your deployed website.

## **Fork the project**

* To create a personal copy of this repository, click on Fork button on the top right corner of the repository page in GitHub.

### **Database Access**

* Heroku Postgres for production
* sqLite3 for development
* AWS S3 for static and media files

* SQLite, by Django has been used for development. Heroku Postgres has been used for production. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been used to host all my static and media files.
